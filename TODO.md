# TODO


## Add "print_list" function
and update docs accordingly.

Note that this function is only for making long  lists more
easily readable. It is NOT intended for printing tables.
For printing tables, see:
https://pypi.org/project/tabulate/


## Testing
Can't have too much testing :-)

Should work with any version of Python >= 3.0
Should work on any platform.
